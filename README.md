# Reusable GitHub Action Workflows

This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions workflows used across Story
Protocol repositories, plus a small set of workflows that maintain this
repository itself.

The source of truth is `.github/workflows/`. Workflow inputs and outputs are
defined under `on.workflow_call`; some older workflows also reference repository
secrets or variables directly.

## Quick Start

Use a reusable workflow from another repository with `jobs.<job_id>.uses`:

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    uses: storyprotocol/gha-workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-lint-go-workflow.yml@main
    with:
      go-version: "1.22"
```

For workflows that require secrets, pass the named secrets explicitly or use
`secrets: inherit` only when that is allowed by the caller repository's policy.

```yaml
jobs:
  notify:
    uses: storyprotocol/gha-workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-slack-notifs.yml@main
    with:
      title: "Build completed"
      short-desc: "The build finished successfully."
      img-alt-text: "Build status"
    secrets:
      channel-name: ${{ secrets.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID }}
      slack-bot-token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
```

## Caller Requirements

These workflows assume the caller repository supplies the expected repository
layout, tools, variables, and secrets.

- AWS ECR workflows require an OIDC-capable AWS role or the expected
  `AWS_ACCOUNT` / `AWS_ACCOUNT_TARGET` secrets, depending on the workflow.
- `reusable-build-and-deploy.yml` requires `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and `DEPLOY_TOKEN`,
  and writes image tag updates to a deployment config repository.
- GCP workflows require the referenced service account secrets and Pub/Sub
  variables, such as `COURIER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` and `COURIER_TOPIC`.
- Slack workflows require a Slack channel ID/name and bot token.
- Node test workflows assume pnpm 8 and Node 20.
- Python test workflows assume `requirements.txt` and `tests/unit` or
  `tests/integration` exist in the caller repository.
- Some workflows assume Story-specific paths, such as `./dockerfile/api`,
  `./dockerfile/temporal-worker`, and `packages/core-sdk/mochawesome-report`.

The AWS access-management workflows call helper scripts from the checked-out
caller repository. Callers must provide the scripts used by the selected
workflow:

- `scripts/parse_config.py`
- `scripts/fetch_all_node_ips.sh`
- `scripts/get_sg_id_by_name.sh`
- `scripts/update_security_group.sh`
- `scripts/revoke_inbound_rules.sh`
- `scripts/remove_ip_from_sg.sh`

## Validation

This repository validates workflow changes through
[`lint-validation.yml`](.github/workflows/lint-validation.yml), which runs
yamllint using [`.github/linters/.yamllint.yml`](.github/linters/.yamllint.yml)
and checks each workflow file has a `name` field.

When changing a reusable workflow, also test it from a caller repository or a
temporary workflow before merging.

## Contributing

When adding or changing a reusable workflow:

1. Put the workflow in `.github/workflows/`.
2. Keep the `workflow_call` inputs, outputs, and secrets explicit.
3. Prefer SHA-pinned third-party actions when practical, and document any
   intentional exception.
4. Update this README with the workflow's current behavior.
5. Add or update detailed docs under `docs/` only when they are kept in sync
   with the workflow.
